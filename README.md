# Dynamo-Docker
Dockerized stuff AND things for DYNAMO coin.

This is very much a work in progress. More refinement / documentation forthcoming.

In short: 

1. Edit the Dockerfile to change the dynamo.conf settings to your liking. DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT USER/PASS. 
2. Build docker image.
3. Run docker image. 

(Better documentation coming.)
